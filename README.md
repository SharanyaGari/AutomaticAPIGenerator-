For this assignment Automatic API Generator tools I chose DronaHQ API Generator to automatically generate a REST API from a dataset.

I went to the API generator tool and opened the dashboard.
I uploaded a CSV file named employees.csv that contains sample employee data.
I named the API as “ EmployeeAPI”.
After naming API I clicked on "Generate API" button to generate endpoints with GET, POST, PUT, DELETE.
Review generated API Endpoints for example :
"https://apigenerator.dronahq.com/api/Rdw6MIdj/EmployeeAPI"
"https://apigenerator.dronahq.com/api/Rdw6MIdj/EmployeeAPI/1"
"https://apigenerator.dronahq.com/api/Rdw6MIdj/EmployeeAPI?_start=10&_end=20"
I have copied some screenshots in the folder.
